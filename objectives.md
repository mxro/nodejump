# nodejump Objectives

## MUST

- enh: implement startup for logged in and anonymous users

- enh: build a share-ui model, which can also be used by edit and view

- enh: improve speed, in which Markdown preview is updated!
 - event listener for editor
 - editor seperate methods for commit to local network, commit to remote partner and load updates from remote partner

- enh: add to this editor add +link button 

## MAYBE

- enh: when text is selected before <button>Insert Link</button> is clicked, this text will automatically be cut & paste into the new document.

- enh: 'hide' links in the editor (upon a click they can be opened and edited?)

- enh: add logic to define forms with markdown, also allow to define a submit button, which will by default append the data from the form to the current node (but also other node can be specified). 
- enh: add 'new application' button to nodejump - this will append and link an application to the currently open node
 - especially useful in combination with the forms (see above).
